# Final Project

1. How do I approach designing software?

  I have gained many new skills over the course of this project. Visual design has not always been my strong suit, but I think I created an appealing scene overall. With this project, I learned how to render objects in OpenGL, apply texture, and various transformations to them. For this project, I first made all my objects, then I applied lighting and texture at the end to give it a little bit of realism. In the future, if I need to design a 3D scene, I can follow the same approach there as well.
  
2. How do I approach developing programs?

  While working on the 3D scene, I tried to make some custom functions in order to make the code more modular and easier to reuse. I probably could have had some more functions since the render function got really long and repeated itself a lot. I followed an iterative approach where I worked on one object at a time and got it where I wanted it in the scene. This helped me to not get overwhelemd by only doing small portions at a time. In the future, I can use this approach in order to finish other projects as well. Larger projects can get overwhelming so it is important to pace yourself. I eneded up using a lot of code from each milestone in order to complete this scene. I don't think my approach changed with each milestone, as I just reused my code in order to get the scene right.
  
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

   I believe that computer science can help me get to my ultimate goal of being a software engineer. I think it is important to be well rounded and know many different programming languages and tools in order to succeed. Many aspects of using OpenGL can be translated to other parts of computer science. I was able to use object oriented programming from previous courses in order to finish this course. This was my first foray in graphic design and I learned a lot from it. I had to learn most of it through watching videos and reading a book on OpenGL. In the future I may be asked to use a program I've never used before, so it's important to be able to find out how to use something effectively.
